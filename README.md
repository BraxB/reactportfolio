## Description

I wanted to get more experience playing with ReactJS, so I converted my previously built portfolio to a react application.

Through this I learned a great deal about react and issues that can come up in deploying a react application through github pages. I also learned that I need to get my styling better organized as this is not exactly optimal in terms of how I set up my styling sheet.
