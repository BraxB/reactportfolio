                    <p>
                    I am a Full-stack web developer looking to leverage extensive experience in digital marketing and graphic design to build efficient and attractive applications. I am currently enrolled in Georgia Techâ€™s full-stack coding bootcamp working on earning my web development certificate. During this time I have been sharpening my skills with NodeJS, CSS, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have worked in JavaScript extensively and in Python to a lesser degree. <br/> <br/> My approach in my projects is to develop applications that are efficient, SEO optimized, mobile friendly, and scalable. I place a heavy emphasis on user experience in my work. Most recently I have had the opportunity to build an application using NodeJS and MySQL that allows for teams to collaborate on t-shirt designs. I am looking forward to continuing to develop my skills and use them to build technologies that just might make the internet and the world a better place.
